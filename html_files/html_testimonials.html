                    landscaping in St. Albert. Christopher Watson, in particular, was professional, polite and
                    hardworking. He wanted to make sure we were
                    happy with the job every step of the way! Thank you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job well done!
                    Great job Christopher!</p>

                <p class="testimonial">I would personally like to extend my gratitude to Parks Landscaping Limited for
                    the incredible work they did for my yard in the Newcastle area. Not only did the crew work
                    diligently to complete my yard in a timely
                    fashion, they were very nice and polite and went out of their way to ensure everything that I asked
                    for was done. They were
                    extremely patient with the issues raised regarding some of the neighbours concerns. They were also
                    always asking me if
                    there was anything more they could do which made me feel that they genuinely wanted to do their best
                    work. The
                    landscaping crew as a whole was beyond fantastic and extremely polite and professional. In
                    particular, I want to thank Matt &
                    Jimmy (who worked on the fence and deck) for being outstanding employees. They not only fixed and
                    addressed all of my
                    concerns but they went out of their way to make sure everything was completed at a high standard.
                    For example, I had
                    mentioned a concern about the grass (even though they were not the ones who put it in) and the next
                    day they brought new sod
                    in and replaced the bad parts. I would also like to extend my gratitude to Chad, as he too went
                    above and beyond to
                    organize everything I asked for. From putting up with all of my phone calls, to following up with
                    all my changes; he made
                    sure our new yard and deck was taken care of. I wanted to write this letter expressing how much I
                    appreciate all of
                    the crew’s hard work, and how impressed I am with Green Thumb Landscaping Limited.</p>

                <p class="testimonial">Green Thumb Landscaping took charge and made my landscaping happen. I had no clue
                    of how to set up my yard, but they came and gave me an awesome plan and executed. The city had put
                    requirements on my property that
                    needed to be met. I was unsure on how to meet the requirements and stay within my budget. After a
                    brief meeting with a park
                    representative they had created a plan that to fulfill the requirements and had booked a time to
                    finish the job. A great
                    thing when you are spending so much money is to see the crew actually working swiftly and not taking
                    long breaks.
                    Park’s guys worked straight until dark each day to finish the job. I would totally recommend Green
                    Thumb Landscaping to
                    anyone. In fact, I did recommend them to a neighbour down the street. He went with Park because they
                    were able to
                    deliver a prompt and professional service. Thank you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job well done!

                <p class="testimonial">We were very impressed. We’ve done a lot of work to our home and property and
                    this has been by far one of the best experiences! They met or exceeded expectations every step of
                    the way. The planning process was fun,
                    the job started the day we’d planned for and the crew was fantastic, working full days until they
                    were done, and
                    touching base with me whenever there were decisions to be made (no matter how minor). We had a patio
                    area put in for our
                    fire pit, added walkways, pea gravel and mulch to the surrounding area and they levelled the lawn
                    and put down new
                    sod. The work was top notch. Even more telling of the high level of professionalism is the care they
                    put into follow up.
                    They’ve contacted us, come out to the house to take a look after the fact and actually asked for
                    feedback to help them do
                    better in the future. I wish all companies cared about their craft as much as the team at Green
                    Thumb Landscaping
                    Ltd. When we’re ready to tackle the front yard we will definitely be working with them again and we
                    would highly
                    recommend them to others 🙂</p>
